  Twenty is the leading open-source CRM, built by a community of hundreds of contributors to meet the unique needs of your business. Designed for flexibility, it helps businesses of all sizes efficiently manage customer relationships and streamline workflows.


  With Twenty, you can easily manage customer data through its contact management system. You can create custom objects and fields to capture information specific to your business operations, ensuring that your CRM is tailored to your needs. The platform offers both Kanban and Table Views, allowing you to visualize your workflow and manage projects in a way that works best for your team.


  It also features pipeline visualization, giving you a clear overview of your processes and helping you track your sales funnel. Email integration is another valuable feature, allowing you to view emails related to a specific customer or company directly within your workspace. This integration ensures that your team can collaborate efficiently without leaving the platform.


  Notes and tasks can be easily added to each record, enabling your team to document key information and track customer interactions. For those needing more advanced automation, Twenty offers API and Webhook support, making it easy to connect to other applications and automate workflows.


  Benefits of using Twenty include improved organization, streamlined communication, better data management, and enhanced collaboration within your team. The flexibility and customization options also ensure that Twenty can adapt as your business grows and changes.


  ⚠️ The Twenty CRM app does not come with preconfigured email or calendar providers. To use services like Gmail or Microsoft Outlook, you need to create your own OAuth credentials and add them as environment variables in the `.env` file in the twenty application directory. Providers will only appear in the interface once valid credentials are set.


  It is also required to configure a reverse proxy like Nginx Proxy Manager or Cloudflare Tunnel in front of the application. The `SERVER_URL` environment variable in the .env file must be set to the URL of your reverse proxy.
