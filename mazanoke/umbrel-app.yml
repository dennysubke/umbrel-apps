  Mazanoke is a privacy-focused image optimizer designed to run entirely in the browser without relying on any external servers. Developed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), it offers a seamless offline experience and can be installed directly on devices for easy access. The core philosophy behind Mazanoke is to empower users to optimize and convert images without compromising their privacy or uploading sensitive data to the cloud.


  Built with modern web technologies, Mazanoke processes images locally, ensuring that all operations remain on the user’s machine. This includes tasks like adjusting image quality, resizing to specific dimensions, converting between formats, and compressing files to meet target size requirements. Supported formats include common types such as JPEG, PNG, and WebP, and the app is also capable of converting SVG and GIF files to optimized PNGs.


  Mazanoke’s interface is responsive and user-friendly, making it suitable for use across desktops, tablets, and smartphones. It automatically adapts to dark or light mode based on the system settings, contributing to a comfortable user experience. While it can be accessed through its hosted version at mazanoke.com, users also have the option to self-host the application, either by serving the static files directly or using the provided Docker configuration for a containerized deployment.


  With its commitment to transparency, Mazanoke is open source and released under the GPL-3.0 license. It caters to individuals and professionals who value control over their data while still requiring a powerful toolset for image optimization and conversion.
